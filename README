This plugin intends to replace the functionality of the m and ' keys that Vim
provides in normal mode. By using this plugin, you don't need to memorize a
register for each line you mark, you just mark it with m. Marked lines go into
a list which is displayed by using the ' mapping. Upon pressing ', the quickfix
window opens, populated with the already marked lines and the editor is
automatically entered into search mode. This way, you can immediately type part
of the line you've previously marked, hit double-enter (the first is to exit
search-mode) and you're exactly where you want to be.
